Block Params
=========

This is a very early [stage 0](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) exploration of a syntactical simplication (heavily inspired by [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html), [Ruby](#ruby) [Groovy](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/latest/html/documentation/core-domain-specific-languages.html)) and [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Closures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH11-ID102) that enables domain specific languages to be developed in userland.

It is a syntactic simplification that allows, on function calls, to omit parantheses around the ***last***  parameter when that's a lambda.

For example:

```javascript
// ... this is what you write ...
a(1) {
  // ...
}

// ... this is what you get ...
a(1, () => {
  // ...
})
```

Functions that take just a single block parameter can also be called parentheses-less:

```javascript
// ... this is what you write ...
a {
  // ...
}

// ... this is what you get ...
a(() => {
  // ...
})
```

We want to enable the ability to nest block params (e.g. to enable paired block params like [select/when](#vbs-select), [builders](#builders) and [layout](#layout)), and we are currently exploring using a sygil (e.g. possibly consistent with the bind operator  ```::```) to refer to the parent block param:

```javascript
// ... this is what you write ...
a(1) {
  ::b(2) {
  }
}

// ... this is somewhat (with some TBD symbol magic) you get ...
a (1, (__parent__) => {
  __parent__.b(2, (__parent__) => {
  })
})
```

Arguments can be passed to the block param:

```javascript
// ... this is what you write ...
a(1) do (foo) { // syntax TBD
  // ...
}

// ... this is what you get ...
a(1, (foo) => {
  ...
})
```

To preserve Tennent's Corresponde Principle, we are exploring which  [restrictions apply](#tennents-correspondence-principle) inside the block param (e.g. because these are based on arrow functions, ```break``` and ```continue``` aren't available as top level constructs and ```return``` may behave differently).

While a simple syntactical simplification, it enables an interesting set of userland frameworks to be built, taking off presure from TC39 to design them (and an extensible [shadowing mechanism](#forward-compatibility) that enables to bake them natively when/if time comes):

Here are some interesting scenarios:

* [flow control](#flow-control) (e.g. [lock](#lock), [unless](#perls-unless), [guard](#swifts-guard), [defer](#swifts-defer), [foreach](#cs-foreach), [select](#vbs-select))
* [builders](#builders) (e.g. [map](#map), [dot](#dot), [data](#custom-data))
* [layout](#layout) (e.g. [html](#kotlins-template), [android](#android))
* [configuration](#configuration) (e.g. [node](#node), [makefiles](#makefiles))
* [others](#misc) (e.g. [regexes](#regexes), [graphql](#graphql), [testing](#testing))

And interesting applications in [DOM construction](https://medium.com/@daveford/80-of-my-coding-is-doing-this-or-why-templates-are-dead-b640fc149e22):

* [JSX](#jsx)
* [template literals](#template-literals)
* [new paradigms](#kotlins-templates)

This is early, so there are still a lot of [areas to explore](#areas-of-exploration) (e.g. [```continue``` and ```break```](#continue-break), [return](#return), [bindings](#bindings) and [```this```](https://github.com/samuelgoto/proposal-block-params/issues/9)) as well as strategic problems to overcome (e.g. [forward compatibility](#forward-compatibility)) and things to check feasibility (e.g. [completion values](#completion-values)).

There is a [polyfill](#polyfill), but I wouldn't say it is a great one quite yet :)

It is probably constructive to start reading from the [prior art](#prior-art) section.

    ::it("should return the sum of the two numbers") {

      shouldEqual(5, sum)
    }
  }
}
```

# Applications

One of the most interesting aspects of this proposal is that it opens the door to statement-like structures inside expressions, which are most notably useful in constructing the DOM.

## Template Literals

For example, instead of:

```javascript
let html = `<div>`;
for (let product of ["apple", "oranges"]) {
  html += `<span>${product}</span>`;
}
html += `</div>`;
```

or

```javascript
let html = `
  <div>
  ${["apple", "oranges"].forEach(product => `<span>${product}</span>`)}
  </div>
`;
```

One could write:

```javascript
let html = `
  <div>
  ${foreach (["apple", "orange"]) {
    `<span>${item()}</span>`
  }}
  </div>
`;
```

## JSX

For example, instead of:

```jsx
// JSX
var box =
  <Box>
    {
      shouldShowAnswer(user) ?
      <Answer value={false}>no</Answer> :
      <Box.Comment>
         Text Content
      </Box.Comment>
    }
  </Box>;
```

One could write:

```jsx
// JSX
var box =
  <Box>
    {
      select (shouldShowAnswer(user)) {
        ::when (true) {
          <Answer value={false}>no</Answer>
        }
        ::when (false) {
          <Box.Comment>
             Text Content
          </Box.Comment>
        }
      }
    }
  </Box>;
```

# Extensions

This can open a stream of future extensions that would enable further constructs to be added. Here are some that occurred to us while developing this.

These are listed here as extensions because I believe we don't corner ourselves by shipping without them (i.e. they can be sequenced independently).

## chaining

From @erights:

To enable something like
```javascript 
if (arg1) {
  ...
} else if (arg2) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

You'd have to chain the various things together. @erights proposed something along the lines of making the chains be passed as parameters to the first function. So, that would transpile to something like

```javascript 
if (arg1, function() {
  ...
},
"else if", arg2, function {
  ...
},
"else", function () {
  ...
})
```

Another notable example may be to enable ```try { ... } catch (e) { ... } finally { ... }```

## functization

From @erights:

To enable control structures that repeat over the lambda (e.g. for-loops), we would need to re-execute the stop condition. Something along the lines of:

```javascript
let i = 0;
until (i == 10) {
  ...
  i++
}
```

We would want to turn ```expr``` into a function that evaluates ```expr``` so that it could be re-evaluated multiple times. For example

```javascript
let i = 0;
until (() => i == 10, function() {
  ...
  i++
})
```

TODO(goto): should we do that by default with all parameters?

# Areas of Exploration

These are some areas that we are still exploring.

## Tennent's Correspondence Principle

To preserve tennent's correspondence principle as much as possible, here are some considerations as we decide what can go into block params:

* ```return``` statements inside the block should either throw ```SyntaxError```  (e.g. kotlin) or jump to a [non-local return](#return) (e.g. kotlin's inline functions [non-local returns](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/inline-functions.html#non-local-returns))
* ```break```, ```continue```  should either throw ```SyntaxError``` or control the [lexical flow](#continue-break)
* ```yield``` can't be used as top level statements (same strategy as ```() => { ... }```)
* ```throw``` works (e.g. can be re-thrown from function that takes the block param)
* the [completion values](#completion-value) are used to return values from the block param (strategy borrowed from [kotlin](#kotlin))
* as opposed to arrow functions, ```this``` can be bound.

## Forward Compatibility

If we bake this in, do we corner ourselves from ever exposing new control structures (e.g. unless () {})?

That's a good question, and we are still evaluating what the answer should be. Here are a few ideas that have been thrown around:

* user defined form shadows built-in ones
* sigils (e.g. for! {})

In this formulation, we are leaning towards the former.

It is important to note that the **current** built-in ones can't be shadowed because they are ```reserved keywords```. So, you can't override ```for``` or ```if``` or ```while``` (which I think is working as intended), but you could override ones that are not reserved keywords (e.g. ```until``` or ```match```).

## Completion Values

Like Kotlin, it is desirable to make the block params return values to the original function calling them. We aren't entirely sure yet what this looks like, but it will most probably borrow the same semantics we end up using in [do expressions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-do-expressions) and other [statement-like expressions](https://github.com/rbuckton/proposal-statements-as-expressions#compound-statements).

```javascript
let result = foreach (numbers) do (number) {
  number * 2 // gets returned to foreach
}
``` 

## scoping

There are certain block params that go together and they need to be somehow aware of each other. For example, ```select``` and ```when``` would ideally be described like this:

```javascript
select (foo) {
  when (bar) {
    ...
  }
}
```

How does ```when``` get resolved?

The global scope? If so, how does it connect with ```select``` to test ```bar``` with ```foo```?

From ```select```? If so, [how does it avoid using the ```this``` reference](https://github.com/samuelgoto/proposal-block-params/issues/16) and have [```with```-like performance implications](https://github.com/samuelgoto/proposal-block-params/issues/13)? perhaps [@@this](https://github.com/samuelgoto/proposal-block-params/issues/20)?

## return

From @bterlson:

It would be great if we could make ```return``` to return from the lexically enclosing function.

Kotlin allows ```return``` from inlined functions, so maybe semantically there is a way out here.

One challenge with ```return``` is for block params that outlive the outer scope. For example:

```javascript
function foobar() {
  run (100) {
    // calls setTimeout(1, block) internally
    return 1;
  }
  return 2;
}
foobar() // returns 2
// after 100 ms
// block() returns 1. does that get ignored?
```
Note that Java throws a [```TransferException```](http://tronicek.blogspot.com/2008/08/nonlocal-transfer.html) when that happens. SmallTalk allows that too, so the intuition is that this is solvable.

## continue, break

```continue``` and ```break``` are interesting because their interpretation can be defined by the user. For example:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  unless (i == 5) {
    // You'd expect the continue to apply to the
    // lexical for, not to the unless
    continue;
  }
}
```

Whereas:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  foreach (array) do (item) {
    if (item == 5) {
      // You'd expect the continue here to apply to
      // the foreach, not the lexical for.
      continue;
    }
  }
}
```

It is still unclear if this can be left as an extension without cornering ourselves.

We are exploring other alternatives [here](https://github.com/samuelgoto/proposal-block-params/issues/8).

## bindings

From @bterlson:

There are a variety of cases where binding helps. For example, we would want to enable something like the following:

```foreach (map) do (key, value) { ... }``` to be given by the foreach function implementation.

```javascript
foreach (map) do (key, value) {
  // ...
}
```

To be equivalent to:

```javascript
// ... is equivalent to ...
foreach (map, function(key, value) {
})
```

Exactly which keyword we pick (e.g. ```in``` or ```with``` or ```:``` etc) and its position (e.g. ```foreach (item in array)``` or ```foreach (array with item)```) TBD.

Another alternative syntax could be something along the lines of:

```javascript
foreach (map) { |key, value|
  // ...
}
```

Or

```javascript
foreach (let {key, value} in map) {
  // ...
}
```

We probably need to do a better job at exploring the design space of use cases before debating syntax, hence leaving this as a future extension.


# Polyfill

  This is currently polyfilled as a transpiler. You can find a lot of examples [here](test/runtime.js).

  `npm install -g @docscript/docscript`

# Tests

# Status

  You really don't want to use this right now. Very early prototype.
